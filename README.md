# Advent of Code 2021 solutions

This repository contains some solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021) 
advent calendar.

The solutions are writte in the [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/)
modelling language. As this is not a language that is made for general
programming, the input data is processed beforehand into suitable
format. The code is located in the **minizinc/** folder, and the file
**minizinc/advent-of-code-2021.mzp** is a project file that includes all
the solutions.


## Warning

MiniZinc is as mentioned not a normal general purpose programming
language, and thus many solutions are solved with the features that
are available. The solutions should not be viewed as good MiniZinc
code at all; they are written to solve the problem at hand and
as a way to have fun.
